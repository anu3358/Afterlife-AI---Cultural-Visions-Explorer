# 🌟 Afterlife AI - Cultural Visions Explorer

### *“What lies beyond? A journey through humanity’s deepest visions of the afterlife begins here...”*

---

Welcome to **Afterlife AI**, a one-of-a-kind cultural simulator that weaves together ancient texts, theological doctrines, spiritual philosophies, and mythological narratives — to explore how different civilizations envision what happens after death. 🌌

Crafted with vision, intellect, and soul — this is **not just software**.  
This is a **spiritual window** into millennia of belief, rendered through AI.  
And it is **done entirely by ANURAG SAINI**.

## ✨ What is this project?

Imagine asking questions like:
- *What does paradise look like in Islamic traditions?*

It blends:
- 🧠 AI-powered semantic search
- 🧾 Database of curated religious & cultural texts
- 📊 NLP & Concept Similarity Analysis
- 🌍 Cross-cultural Comparisons
- 🎨 A beautiful web interface for interaction

All this, running **locally on your machine** via:
